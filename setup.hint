ldesc: "The perlDL project aims to turn perl into an efficient numerical
language for scientific computing. The PDL module gives standard perl
the ability to COMPACTLY store and SPEEDILY manipulate the large
N-dimensional data sets which are the bread and butter of scientific
computing. e.g. $a=$b+$c can add two 2048x2048 images in only a fraction
of a second."
